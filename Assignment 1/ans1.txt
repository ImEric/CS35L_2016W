   ./.lesshst
   ./.bash_profile
   ./.bashrc
   ./.bash_history
   (To find under current directory: find . -mtime -21 -print)
   (Or under the root directory: find / -mtime -21 -print 2</dev/null)
   ("2</dev/null" prevents error(e.g: permission declined)from being printed)

8. 20
   (first find the directory of find using: which find)
   (then using regex to find symbolic links: ls -la /bin | grep "\->" | wc -l)
   (or simply find using -type -l | wc -l)

9. 2003-08-29+12:56:11 /usr/lib/x86_64-redhat-linux5E/include/bits/stdio-lock.h
   (Done by: find /usr/lib -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 1)

    C-M-f: forward sexp
    C-M-g: Not found

    	   (For example, select the whole text region currently editing)
