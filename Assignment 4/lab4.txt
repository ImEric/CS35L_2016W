1. 	Clone Diffutils to local repository
		$ git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2. 	Save the log of changes to git-log.txt
		$ git log > ~/git-log.txt

3. 	Save the list of tags to git-tags.txt
		$ git tag > ~/git-tags.txt

4. 	Search for "maint: quote 'like this' ... " in git.lot.txt
	Find the commit code and save the commit to quote-patch.txt
		$ git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > ~/quote-patch.txt

5.	Checkout verson 3.0
		$ git checkout v3.0
	Copy the source files to ~/diffutils-3.0 for later use
		$ cp -r ~/diffutils/src ~/diffutils-3.0

6.	Patch v3.0 with quote-patch.txt 
		$ patch -p1 < ~/quote-patch.txt
				-strips only one / from the patch directory
				-since I am currently at the parent directory of
				-files to be patched
	Result:
		- 	Several patches were skipped 
			as the file to be patch can't be found:
				a/HACKING)
				a/doc/diffutils.texi
				a/man/help2man
		-	Several Hunks failed and the rejects were saved.



7.	See what modification has been made
		$  git status

		Changes not staged for commit:
			modified:   NEWS
			...
			modified:   tests/help-version
		Untracked files:
			NEWS.orig
			...
			tests/help-version.orig

8.	Learn the Emacs functions vc-diff (C-x v =) and vc-revert (C-x v u). 

9.	Use Emacs to revert all the changes to files other than .c files
		$ git ls-files -m | grep "[^c]$"
		(display all modified files excluding .c files)

			NEWS
			README
			TODO
			doc/diagmeet.note
			ms/config.bat
			ms/config.site
			po/en.po
			src/diff.h
			src/system.h
			tests/help-version

	Use emacs to apply the following on each files
	(Required by Assign Specs)
 
		C-x v =
		C-x v u

	Alternatively, to save time, one can try (not using Emacs)e
		$ git checkout -- $(git ls-files -m | grep "[^c]$")


	Now, undo all the changes to .c files 
	(other than changes to character string constants)
		$ git ls-files -m | grep ".c$"

			src/analyze.c
			src/cmp.c
			src/context.c
			src/diff.c
			src/diff3.c
			src/dir.c
			src/ifdef.c
			src/io.c
			src/sdiff.c
			src/side.c
			src/util.c

		C-x v =		:	Show vc-diff buffer 
		C-M-i		:	Move to next Hunk
		C-u C-c	C-a	:	Undo hunk

10. Copy rejected patches into the corresponding .c files as needed.
		$ ls -a ./src | grep ".c.rej$"

			diff3.c.rej
			diff.c.rej

		C-c C-c 	: 	Go to source
	

11. $ git clean -f

12. $ git diff > ~/quote-3.0-patch.txt

	modified:   src/cmp.c
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/diff3.c
	modified:   src/dir.c
	modified:   src/sdiff.c
	modified:   src/util.c

13. $ ./bootstrap
	$ ./configure
	$ make
		(success)
	$ make check
		(gives some error, asked TA, replied that it does not matter)

	$ diff . -
	diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

	$ diff --help
	To veriery every ` is changed to ',  check by $ diff --help | grep "\`"
